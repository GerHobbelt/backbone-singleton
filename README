We define three methods
  model.capture()
    submits a free model to the model store (discard it after)
    returns the model from the model store
  model.release()
    used to tell the store you're done with it
  model.hash()
    returns the id - can be overidden

We have two static methods
  Backbone.SingletonModel.extend() is patched to give each subclass its own singleton store                    
  Backbone.SingletonModel.reap() deletes all models who's referece count is below 1

We have one property
  model.singleton - Boolean if the model is in the store - this happens when hash() returns undef

To use me - just extend me
  var CoolModel = Backbone.SingletonModel.extend({});

TODO:
  Stop always creating models!
    I like how hash() always a model to work with but it's bad form to consturct something and then toss it away
  More tests
